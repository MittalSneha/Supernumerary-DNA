# Supernumerary-DNA

In this work, we have coupled the nanoscale transverse tunneling approach with machine learning (ML) for reading and writing the 12-letter supernumerary DNA code (A, T, G, C, B, S, P, Z, X, K, J, V) with high precision and accuracy. For writing, we leverage the ML regression tools, which predict the transmission signatures of each natural and xenonucleobase with low mean squared error as validated through DFT. For reading the 12-letter code, we have developed the ML-grey box classification model that trained on only four features extracted from the transmission profile, decode each standard code (A, T, G, C), isoG/isoC code (A, T, G, C, B, S), hachimoji code (A, T, G, C, B, S, P, Z) and supernumerary code (A, T, G, C, B, S, P, Z, X, K, J, V) with good accuracy.
